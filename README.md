# Introduction to programming

This is some material prepared for a Meetup, which goal is to provide some introduction to programming.

The target audience is people that never wrote code.

This introduction will cover some basic principles:
- The primitives of the Python language
- The basic constructions of an imperative language: conditionals and loops
- The simplest ways of abstraction supported by all languages: functions
